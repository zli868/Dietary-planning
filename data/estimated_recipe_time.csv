Julia Child's Boeuf Bourguignon,"Recipe Name: Julia Child's Boeuf Bourguignon
Blanch the bacon to remove its smoky taste. Drop bacon slices into 2 quarts of cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer 6 to 8 minutes.
Drain, rinse in cold water, and dry on paper towels.In a large frying pan, saut the blanched bacon to brown slightly in a little oil; set them aside and add later to simmer with the beef, using the rendered fat in browning. Brown the chunks of beef on all sides in the bacon fat and olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and put them into a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or covered casserole pan.
Cut the bacon into 1-inch pieces and add to the pan.
Remove all but a little fat from the frying pan, add the sliced vegetables and brown them, and add to the meat.

The Granny Smith apples are diced quite small and then cooked in a reduction of honey, apple cider vinegar and spices. Granny Smiths are good to use because they won't break down into apple sauce during the cooking. The cooked apples are then used as a top crust and glaze for the roast pork. Some garlic roast potatoes and steamed veggies completed a wonderful family meal. Here's your Sunday supper!Lb pork loin or rib roast
Season the pork with salt and pepper and open roast on a rack in a roasting pan at 375 degrees F for about a half hour.Meanwhile dice very small, (about a 1/4 inch dice)Large Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored

Preheat the oven on 200 C (about 390 F).
Size of the baking dish: around 14 inch long, 10 inch wide, 3.2 inch deep
Roll the pastry thin, in to the size of your baking dish. You should roll half of pastry for the bottom side of cakes and half of pastry for upper side off the cakes. The size should be just a little bigger than the size of your baking dish.
Bake the pastry for about 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool the upper layer completely. Leave the second one (bottom layer) in the baking dish.

White Chocolate Cheesecake With Raspberries,"Recipe Name: White Chocolate Cheesecake With Raspberries
To make the crumb crust
In a small bowl combine the graham crumbs, sugar and melted butter.
Press into the bottom of a lightly greased springform pan. (Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.)
To prepare the cheesecake
In a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it.
Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter.
Cream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Stir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate.
Finally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth.
Pour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point.
Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface)
Allow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature. (Do not put a hot cheesecake into the fridge to cool quickly, this may result in an under baked cheesecake because the residual heat actually continues to set the cheesecake after it comes out of the oven).
To finish the cheesecake
When completely cool cover the top with fresh raspberries and garnish with melted white chocolate if desired.
Chill completely in the refrigerator until ready to serve.","- Combine and press the crumb crust: 10 minutes.
- Melt white chocolate with cream and cool: 15 minutes.

Swiss Chard Wraps,"Recipe Name: Swiss Chard Wraps
Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.
Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.
Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown.
Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked.
Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.
Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.
To assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down.
Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk.
Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.
Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.
These wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.","Chop the swiss chard stems: 2 minutes

Healthy Mint Brownies,"Recipe Name: Healthy Mint Brownies
Combine the flax, applesauce and almond milk together in a small bowl. Set aside to allow to thicken. In a food processor, combine the blueberries, pear, black beans and oil. Pulse until the mixture become very smooth. Next, add the extracts and process until fully combined.
Remove the contents from processor into a medium sized mixing bowl.
Add the coconut sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda, and salt and mix.
Add the flour with the chocolate chips and mix until just combined.
Pour the batter into your prepared dish and bake at 350 for 44-45 minutes.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 50 minutes. If you would like, place the brownies in the fridge for 20 or 30 minutes to speed up cooling time. While the brownies cool, start on your mint filling.In a small bowl, combine the soft avocado with full fat coconut milk or heavy cream. Beat on high for about 5 minutes until the mixture is fluffy and smooth.
Add the powdered xylitol and mix well.
Add peppermint extract and coloring if desired, and beat until all incorporated. Once the mixture is perfectly fluffy and creamy, add the flour and mix until just combined. The mixture should be thick and smooth but still easy to spread.
Spread the mixture evenly over the cooled brownies and place in the fridge for 10 minutes, until the mint filling has firmed.Next, melt the chocolate.
Add the oil to the melted chocolate and stir to combine.
Remove the brownies from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate over the brownies, gently and quickly spread the chocolate evenly over the brownies. The mint filling should be cold so the warm chocolate doesnt melt the mint filling, but the chocolate will cool quickly once it touches the cold mint. Make sure to work quickly so the chocolate layer will be even. Return the brownies to the fridge to cool for another 5 minutes until the chocolate is set.
Cut the brownies after the 5 minutes with a sharp knife.
Serve brownies chilled or at room temperature. Store any left overs in an airtight container in the refrigerator.NOTE: Once the chocolate layer has firmed, be sure to cut all the brownies immediately with a sharp knife. I cut some of the brownies when they were really, really cold, and they didnt cut clean and pretty.*For those who are not concerned with gluten content, wheat or white flour would work okay as well. For wheat, decrease the amount by 1 tablespoon. For the filling, be sure to use a white color flour to keep the mint filling a bright pretty green color.**You can use any kind of chocolate you like, but dark chocolate gives a wonderful flavor to the peppermint and sugar free dark chocolate is the easiest to find.","1.
